As the coronavirus pandemic spreads, there has been an increasing move towards online teaching. Delivering large scale teaching online comes with a myriad of challenges. A lesson we have learnt by delivering such a course unit at the University of Manchester, was the vital part of employing teaching assistants (TAs) to support the studentsâ€™ learning experience and make learning more engaging and interactive.

In this external blog post (published on Medium), we discuss the practical steps we took in organising and supporting the role of TAs in the fully online undergraduate unit AI: Robot Overlord, Replacement or Colleague? (referred to as Robot Overlord) which since then have been adopted in various other units across faculties. We also provide a set of templates and a TA starting pack, we have used to support the TAs.
