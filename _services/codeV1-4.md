The new version of the AI Code of Conduct is live and introduces a new tiered system of three levels of guidelines for the safe and ethical use of generative AI tools.

The three tiers provide guidelines for the individual use of generative AI tools emphasising that any output should not be blindly trusted and **always apply critical thinking**

The second tier provides ground rules for use of generative AI tools in the **learning journey**, including assessment. The rules highlight the need for evaluating the output and verifying with trustworthy sources, properly referencing and citing any outputs used in submissions. 

The third tier provides four ethical principles to consider and implement when using generative AI tools, especially when **developing new applications** using these tools, or when **disseminating outputs** in a wider audience.
